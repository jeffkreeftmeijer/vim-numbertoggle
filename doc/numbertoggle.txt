*numbertoggle.txt*	(auto-)toggling for Vim line numbers

Author:  Jeff Kreeftmeijer <http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com>

INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

numbertoggle cleverly toggles between relative/hybrid and absolute line number 
mode when switching between normal and insert mode and when focus is lost or 
gained.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR                                *numbertoggle-default-behavior*

If you want to open document with absolute line number, you can set 
g:AbsoluteNumberWhenOpening to any value but zero, typically one:

  let g:AbsoluteNumberWhenOpening = 1

Otherwise, set g:AbsoluteNumberWhenOpening to 0 or leave it alone.

TRIGGER                                         *numbertoggle-trigger*

In case g:UseNumberToggleTrigger is unset or true, NumberToggle sets
up <C-n> to toggle from absolute to relative line numbers.
You can set up another trigger if you prefer. If you want to
toggle using <F2>, for example, put this into your ~/.vimrc file:

  let g:NumberToggleTrigger="<F2>"
