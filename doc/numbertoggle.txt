INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

While Vim's relativenumber option is great, you probably don't want to use it
all the time. numbertoggle allows you to quickly toggle between relative and
absolute line numbers and cleverly switches when when focus is lost or gained
or when switching between normal and insert mode.

TRIGGER                                         *numbertoggle-trigger*

In case g:UseNumberToggleTrigger is unset or true, NumberToggle sets
up <C-n> to toggle from absolute to relative line numbers.
You can set up another trigger if you prefer. If you want to
toggle using <F3>, for example, put this into your ~/.vimrc file:

    nmap <silent> <F3> <Plug>NumberToggleTrigger

SHOW/HIDE ALL NUMBERS                        *numbertoggle-showhide*

If you want a convenient way to show or hide *all* numbers in the buffer, you
can map a key to `<Plug>NumberToggleShowHideAll`. This is not mapped by
default, but to map this functionality to, for example, '<Leader><F3>', add the
following to your ~/.vimrc file:

    nmap <silent> <Leader><F3> <Plug>NumberToggleShowHideAll
