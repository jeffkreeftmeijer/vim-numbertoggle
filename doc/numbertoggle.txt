*numbertoggle.txt*	(auto-)toggeling for Vim line numbers

INTRODUCTION                                    *numbertoggle*

While Vim's relativenumber option is great, you probably don't want to use it
all the time. numbertoggle allows you to quickly toggle between relative and
absolute line numbers and cleverly switches when when focus is lost or gained
or when switching between normal and insert mode.

TRIGGER                                         *numbertoggle-trigger*

NumberToggle sets up <C-n> to toggle from absolute to relative line numbers by
default, but you can set up another trigger if you prefer. If you want to
toggle using <F2>, for example, put this into your ~/.vimrc file:

  let g:NumberToggleTrigger="<F2>"

MINIMUM EDITOR WIDTH                            *numbertoggle-min-cols*

When g:numbertoggle_min_cols is set, the plugin will only show line numbers
if there are at least g:numbertoggle_min_cols available in your window.

This allows one to have the line numbering turned off when working in
narrow terminals and activate automatically for wider terminals.

  let g:numbertoggle_min_cols=80
